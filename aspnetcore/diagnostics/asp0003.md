# ASP0003: Do not use model binding attributes with route handlers

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |ASP0003|
| **Category** |Usage|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A route handler delegate includes a parameter that has a [<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.BindAttribute>] attribute.

## Rule description

Route handler endpoints do not support using MVC's model binding semantics to resolve parameter data from sources. This is because the model binding semantics are designed to be used with the [<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerContext>][ControllerContext] and [<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ActionContext>][ActionContext] properties. For example, the following code will result in an analyzer warning.

```csharp
app.MapGet("/todos/{id}", ([Bind] int id) => new Todo { Id = id });
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, make sure that the endpoint uses one of the allowed model binding attributes.

```csharp
app.MapGet("/todos/{id}", ([FromRoute] int id) => new Todo { Id = id });
```

## When to suppress warnings

Do ***not*** suppress a warning from this rule. An incorrect model binding setup can result in unexpected behavior when resolving parameters at runtime.
